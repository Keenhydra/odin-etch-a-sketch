# odin-etch-a-sketch
Project Etch-a-Sketch for The Odin Project

Simple Etch-a-Sketch that creates a drawn line on a mouse over.
The grid is able to scale from 8x8 squares to 64x64 squares.
Functions exist for drawing, erasing and clearing the grid, as well as one to show the grid lines.

Further process will continue on creating a function for 0.2 increase for opacity and a rainbow function for the draw. 

Planned feature to disengage draw/erase functions when another is engaged.
